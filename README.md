# Disease-Prediction
The project seeks to put into practise a reliable machine-learning model that can accurately forecast a person's sickness based on the symptoms that person exhibits.
**Approach:**
-Getting the Information
-Organising the Data Model 
-Creating Inference
Finally, a function will be defined that accepts a list of symptoms separated by commas, uses the trained models to forecast the disease based on the symptoms, and delivers the predictions in a JSON format.
